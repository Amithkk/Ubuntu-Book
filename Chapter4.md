A little plain, huh?

Lets spice things up with a cool wallpaper.

First, download a wallpaper you like - I'm just going to use one that 
I've had for a few months and lost track of where I found it.


Open up System Settings.

1. The default wallpaper list.
2. The current background - this is what your computer looks like
3. The options to select a theme.


Click the little "+" button to the bottom left of the wallpaper list.

Navigate to where your wallpaper is (mine is in the Download folder)
and then click the "Open" button. 

Now take a look!
