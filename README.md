##Oh hello.

Travel back with me to the year 2010. A young, brash teenager gets a netbook, and
doesn't want to use Windows 7 Starte edition on it (there might have been a Dad saying 
"I won't help you when you have issues" somewhere in there).

So he downloads Ubuntu 10.04 LTS netbook remix, and is immediately lost in the sea
of all the forums, noise and "Getting started with Ubuntu!" blog posts.

This is an attempt to prevent that from happening to another person. 

Yeah, there are projects like the Ubuntu Manual - but the goal of this isn't to make
"**The** Ubuntu Manual", but rather to create a short and sweet booklet
about getting started with Ubuntu.

<sub>Another goal is to keep it up-to-date, and have the next release of Ubuntu covered
  before release day, something that most projects struggle with.
